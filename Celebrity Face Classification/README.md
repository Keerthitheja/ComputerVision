# Celebrity Face Classification
This project is done as a sub part of the second project of the course Computer Vision at KU Leuven. The .ipynb notebook can be run directly on Google Colab. 
A VGG16 Model is trained on the facial dataset of Hollwywood celebrities available at http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face/vgg_face_dataset.tar.gz

The VGG Model is then trained on some classes of selected celebrities and their look alikes using transfer learning. The pre-trained weights (VGG FACE) are loaded directly from the keras library.

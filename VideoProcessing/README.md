Numpy : 1.18.1

## Performing basic computer Vision techniques on video frames. 

With this project we get an idea of how to read image frames from a video and apply some of the computer vision techniques on each image frame and then create a video out of the processed frames.

The .ipynb has the python code that reads a input video file available at [a relative link](SourceVideoFile/InputVideoFile.mp4)
